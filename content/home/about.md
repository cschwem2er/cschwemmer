# About


I am an Interim Professor for Political Sociology at University of Bamberg and a Postdoctoral Researcher working in the field of Computational Social Science at GESIS. My research focuses on applying computational methods for ethnic minority & gender studies, digital media, political communication and sociotechnical systems. I am particularly interested in methods related to natural language processing, image recognition and data mining.

Results of my work have been published in journals such as *Computers in Human Behavior*, *European Sociological Review*, *Social Media + Society*, *European Journal of Political Research* and *West European Politics*.

In addition to research, I taught courses about Data Analysis, Data Mining, Quantitative Text Analysis and Political Sociology at University of Bamberg, University of Konstanz, Humboldt University of Berlin and University of Stuttgart.
