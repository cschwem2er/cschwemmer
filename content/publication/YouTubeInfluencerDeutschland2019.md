abstract = "Social media are increasingly important for adolescents in Germany. At the same time, social media are used by influencers because of monetary incentives such as product placement. This study deals with networking between influencers by conducting network analysis of the most popular German YouTube channels. Results shed light on structures of commercialization, which in turn have important implications for media consumption of adolescents. [Please note: this paper is published in German language]"
